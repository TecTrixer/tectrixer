### Hi there, im TecTrixer

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on legal tech startup, check out [easy-case.de](https://easy-case.de) for more information
- ðŸ¦€ I love writing rust, it is fast, safe and has one of the best ecosystems :)
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m a big fan of low level performance oriented problems, here are two of my current projects:
  1. Designing an instruction set and building a VM which can interpret it.
  2. Building a high performance stock order processing server.
- ðŸ’¬ I also enjoy solving competitive programming problems (e.g. those on [codeforces.com](https://codeforces.com) or on [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com))
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: write an email to tonihoevedes@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: in my freetime I love playing table tennis and sometimes I even find the time to practice playing piano.
