### Hi there, im TecTrixer

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a full stack project for a friend starting an arma organization (server, website, roles, discord + teamspeak integration, ...)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to write good and memory efficient code with rust (also some challenges on codingforce.com)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the Linux Kernel and other OS projects, but thats probably not gonna happen soon :)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about linux and how its centuries better than windows :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: write an email to tonihoevedes@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I also play the piano

Unfortunatly the stats only include my personal repositories but not the ones from organizations so they are not complete :(
